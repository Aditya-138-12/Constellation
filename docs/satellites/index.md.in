# Constellation Satellites

These pages provide an overview of the satellites shipped with the Constellation framework.

Detailed descriptions of how to implement new satellites in either C++ or Python can be found in [the user guide](../manual/index).
New satellites may be included in the main repository and the distribution of Constellation if they serve a wider community or
a category of devices.
