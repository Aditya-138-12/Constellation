# Protocols & Communication Channels

Several independent communication channels are required which would follow well-known communication patterns such as publish/subscribe to distribute commands or disseminate logging messages, push/pull for status updates from satellite applications to the command-and-control server, and possibly for data transmission.
The framework would come with few dependencies only, be lightweight and would provide a simple interface to allow for fast integration of new satellite applications. Graphical user interfaces should be made available to steer the command-and-control server and/or some of the satellite applications.
