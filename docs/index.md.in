```{sidebar}
![Logo](logo.png)
```

Constellation is a control and data acquisition system for small-scale
experiments and experimental setup with volatile and dynamic constituents such
as testbeam environments or laboratory test stands.

Constellation aims to provide a flexible SCADA software system that requires
minimal effort for the integration of new devices, that is based on widely
adopted open-source network communication libraries and that keeps the required
maintenance as low as possible.
